An extremely fast static web-server and reverse proxy for the modern web. More info is available on [KatWebX.kittyhacker101.tk](https://katwebx.kittyhacker101.tk/).

## Important Info
KatWebX is still a work in progress, and you may encounter issues. **KatWebX is not well tested, production use is not recommended!**  Some releases are more stable than others, anything from the releases page is likely to be far more stable than the current code in the git repository.

## Release Schedule
Approximate dates for the release of KatWebX are listed below.
- July - Pre releases, containing all features being partially or fully implemented. No new features will be added between now and the release, and the codebase will be cleaned up to improve performance and maintainability. Pre-releases will not be production-ready.
- August - Evaluation releases, containing all features being fully implemented, and a somewhat performant and readable codebase. No functionality changes will be made between now and the release, only performance optimizations, minor code cleanup, and bug fixes will be implemented at this time. Evaluation releases are intended for testing how well KatWebX functions in a production environment, but they are not intended for use in large-scale deployments or critical systems.
- September - A fully-functional, production-ready, 1.0 release will be finished and packaged. Additional updates will only add minor functionality changes, focusing mostly on performance improvments and bug fixes.

## Known issues (as of this document's writing)
- Pre-release 1 and older will slowly leak memory, especially with large files. Restarting the server occasionally will fix this issue. This has been fixed in the current git version.
- Pre-release 1 and older will show a server-generated file listing with a seemingly random order, on unix-based systems. This has been fixed in the current git version.
- The current git version's reverse proxy misbehaves when dealing with servers that don't support keep-alive.
- The current git version's websocket implementation is buggy at best, and nonfunctional at worst.
- The current git version has some minor bugs that can cause clients to misbehave. This is an upstream issue, and will be fixed soon.

## Current Features
- Easy to read TOML configuration
- Flexible configuration parsing
- Regex-based redirects
- Compressed regex-based reverse proxy
- Websocket reverse proxying
- HTTP basic authentication
- Extremely fast file serving
- Brotli file compression
- Systemd/systemfd socket listening
- On-the-fly config reloading
- HSTS support
- SNI and OCSP response stapling
- High performance HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3
- Multiple logging formats
- Material design server-generated pages

## Possible Features (probably won't be implemented soon, but a possibility in the future)
- Let's Encrypt integration (Difficult but practical to implement, possible in the future)
- Caching proxy (Currently very difficult to implement, unlikely to be implemented in the near future)
- Advanced load balancer (May be implemented in the future)
- Support for more architectures (Likely to be implemented eventually, requires dependencies to be updated)

## Unlikely features (will not be implemented soon or at all)
- QUIC support (The underlying HTTP library (actix-web) doesn't support it, and [only 1 browser supports it out of the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC#Adoption). Until it gets more adoption, I'm not going to put effort into adding it myself.)
- CGI/FastCGI support (There are no existing client libraries for Rust, and there's no real reason to implement it anyways. [HTTP/2 can do everything that FastCGI does](https://ef.gy/fastcgi-is-pointless), and KatWebX has an HTTP/2 capable reverse proxy built-in.)
- SPDY support ([SPDY is dying](https://caniuse.com/#feat=spdy), as it's being replaced by HTTP/2. KatWebX has full support for HTTP/2.)
- TLS 1.1 or older ([All recent browsers support TLS 1.2 or higher](https://caniuse.com/#feat=tls1-2), and these older TLS protocols are very insecure.)
- Documentation in other languages (I don't know any other languages, and I don't have the resources to hire a translator.) (iswearibehave-igotthemoooooooo is here for you)
